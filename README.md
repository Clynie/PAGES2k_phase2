# Kevin created a sensitivity branch

# PAGES2k_phase2
Data and Matlab code for the second phase of the PAGES2k synthesis of temperature-sensitive proxies.
The main goal of this repository is to give project collaborators


4 pieces of code to know about:

- **pages2k_composite_prep.m** prepares the data for compositing

- **pages2k_composite_sensitivity.m** makes various composites by slicing and dicing in various ways.
 FEEL FREE TO ADD TO THIS AD NAUSEAM!

 - **pages2k_composite_regression.m** produces the temperature-scaled composite with error estimates

Al the data are in "data". The figures are all exported to "figs"
Code utilities are including in "utilities". If you are missing anything, we will be happy to include it.

It's still a mess but hopefully it's a well-commented mess.
