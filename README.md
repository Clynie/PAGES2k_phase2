# PAGES2k phase2 composite
Data and Matlab code for the second phase of the PAGES2k synthesis of temperature-sensitive proxies.
The main goal of this repository is to give project collaborators

## Organization
X pieces of code to know about:

- **pages2k_composite_prep.m** prepares the data for compositing

- **pages2k_composite_sensitivity.m** makes various composites by slicing and dicing in various ways.
 FEEL FREE TO ADD TO THIS AD NAUSEAM!

- **pages2k_composite_regression.m** produces the temperature-scaled composite with error estimates

Al the data are in "data". The figures are all exported to "figs"
Code utilities are including in "utilities". If you are missing anything, we will be happy to include it.

## To contribute
### Do you GitHub?
If you have gotten this far, it means that you successfully created an account. Great!
The next step is to get familiar with [version control](https://backlogtool.com/git-guide/en/intro/intro1_1.html) in general, and [GitHub in particular](http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1).

We note that the learning curve is much smoother with a [Desktop App](https://desktop.github.com/) (Mac and Windows only. If you are on Linux, presumably this means that you can't possibly get enough of the command line, so you'll be fine)

### Start a branch
Instructions on how to start a branch. The project leader (Julien) will be notified that you have done so, automatically.

### Create a new file (or more)
please name it pages2k_composite_sensitivity_to_[feature of your choice].m, or use a very descriptive name so that it doesn't get lost with everyone else'e edits.

### Hack away
Make figures, tables, and analyses. Explain what you've done using abundant comments.

### Make a pull request
This will inform the project leader (Julien) that your changes are ready to be shared. I will review them and incorporate them to the master branch if appropriate.

### Repeat until you have assuaged all your inner doubts about the virtues of a composite
(this make take a while)
